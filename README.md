### Hi there and welcome to my profile👋!

I am Navodith Shankar. I'm a passionate junior at NJIT, pursuing a major in Computer Science and Business with a minor in Data Analytics. 📚 

💻🎮 My coding arsenal includes Python, Java, and C, allowing me to bring innovative ideas to life and solve intricate problems. I've got a solid grip on SQL for managing data, and crafting impactful visualizations using tools like Tableau and Power BI.

📊 When I'm not immersed in code or crunching data, you can find me watching boxing matches or tennis matches, listening to music or indulging in my favorite hobby - Cars. 🥊🎾 I believe that sports, like technology, teach us about dedication, strategy, and the thrill of competition. I also have an eclectic taste in music that keeps my creative juices flowing.

🌟 In the realm of data analysis, I'm well-versed in various Python libraries that help me uncover meaningful insights from complex datasets. Whether it's trend analysis, predictive modeling, or crafting compelling data stories, I'm up for the challenge!

Feel free to connect with me to discuss tech, share car enthusiast stories, chat about music and games, or even dissect the latest boxing match or tennis showdown! 🚗🎶🎮🥊🎾
